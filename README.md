# .vim

Well, here is a **Yet Another** `.vim` repository for my own. I don't think that
this repository will serve a good for you but, hey, you can try.

I also set another goal for this repository: **no user interface shall be
used**. Sound funny, but I'll not use graphical tools like Atom, GitHub, etc.

Hope that this crazy idea won't become a messy git commit logs.
